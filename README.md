```php
// Initialize Ably REST client
$ably = new AblyRest(['key' => 'your-ably-api-key', 'clientId' => 'me']);

// Get a reference to the 'test-channel' channel
$channel = $ably->channel('test-channel');

// Publish a test message to the channel
$channel->publish('test-event', 'hello world');
```

### Ably REST API

This SDK currently supports only the [Ably REST API](https://www.ably.com/docs/rest). For realtime capabilities, you can use the [MQTT adapter](https://www.ably.com/docs/mqtt) alongside [Mosquitto PHP](https://github.com/mgdm/Mosquitto-PHP) to implement Ably's Realtime features.
